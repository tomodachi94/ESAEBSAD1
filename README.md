# ESAEBSAD

**Experimental-Self-Aware-Electronic-Based-Space-Analyzing-Droid** (**E.S.A.E.B.S.A.D.** or just **ESAEBSAD** for short) is an IRC/wiki bot created by/for Xbony2, with various very useful and various very silly commands.

ESAEBSAD is written in Ruby, using the Cinch and MediaWiki-Butt gems.

## Running
First, make sure there is a `config.yml` file in this directory; this is required for ESAEBSAD to function. For the default configuration (minus the password), view `lib/resources/defaults/config.yml`.

To run ESAEBSAD, you should simply execute the following in Terminal.
```bash
cd whereeverthisfolderis
ruby run.rb
```
