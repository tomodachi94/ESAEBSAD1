==============================================================

My IRC bot (E.S.A.E.B.S.A.D. for short). It's written in Ruby, using the cinch gem. It includes several useless functions, like a url shortening command and a die roll command. 

TODO:
* Group API, so others can use useful commands.
* Create a command that is some sort of programming interpeter, something basic and something compact.
* Convert to plugins system.
* Refactor.
